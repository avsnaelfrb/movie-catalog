# TODO: Implement Login and Register Pages

## Steps:

1. [x] Update src/App.jsx to set up React Router with routes for / (home), /login, /register.
2. [x] Create src/pages/login.jsx: Login component with form for email and password, API call to backend /login, store token on success, redirect to /.
3. [x] Create src/pages/register.jsx: Register component with form for name, email, password, API call to backend /, redirect to /login on success.
4. [x] Create src/style/Login.css and src/style/Register.css for styling.
5. Test the implementation by running the app and ensuring backend is running for API calls.
